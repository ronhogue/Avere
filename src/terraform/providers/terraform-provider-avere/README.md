# Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:
* <a name="controller_address"></a>[controller_address](#controller_address) - (Optional if [run_local](#run_local) is set to true) the ip address of the controller.  This address may be public or private.  If private it will need to be reachable from where terraform is executed.
* <a name="controller_admin_username"></a>[controller_admin_username](#controller_admin_username) - (Optional if [run_local](#run_local) is set to true) the admin username to the controller
* <a name="controller_admin_password"></a>[controller_admin_password](#controller_admin_password) - (Optional) only specify if [run_local](#run_local) is set to false and password is to be used to access the key, instead of the ssh key ~/.ssh/id_rsa
* <a name="controller_ssh_port"></a>[controller_ssh_port](#controller_ssh_port) - (Optional) only specify if [run_local](#run_local) is set to false and the ssh is a value other than the default port 22.
* <a name="run_local"></a>[run_local](#run_local) - (Optional) specifies if terraform is run directly on the controller (or similar machine with vfxt.py, az cli, and averecmd).  This defaults to false, and if false, a minimum of [controller_address](#controller_address) and [controller_admin_username](#controller_admin_username) must be set.
* <a name="use_availability_zones"></a>[use_availability_zones](#use_availability_zones) - (Optional) specify true to spread the nodes across availability zones for HA purposes.  By default this is set to false.  This feature only works in [regions that support availability zones](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/geographies/) and with 3 node clusters.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="allow_non_ascii"></a>[allow_non_ascii](#allow_non_ascii) - (Optional) non-ascii characters can break deployment so this is set to `false` by default.  In more advanced scenarios, the ascii check may be disabled by setting to `true`.
* <a name="location"></a>[location](#location) - (Required) specify the azure region.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="azure_resource_group"></a>[azure_resource_group](#azure_resource_group) - (Required) this is the azure resource group to install the vFXT.  This must be the same resource as the controller, or increase the RBAC scope of the controller's managed identity roles with a different resource group.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="azure_network_resource_group"></a>[azure_network_resource_group](#azure_network_resource_group) - (Required) this is the resource group of the VNET to where the vFXT will be deployed.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="azure_network_name"></a>[azure_network_name](#azure_network_name) - (Required) this is the name of the VNET to where the vFXT will be deployed.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="azure_subnet_name"></a>[azure_subnet_name](#azure_subnet_name) - (Required) this is the name of the subnet to where the vFXT will be deployed.  As a best practice the Avere vFXT should be installed in its own VNET.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="ntp_servers"></a>[ntp_servers](#ntp_servers) - (Optional) A space separated list of up to 3 NTP servers for the Avere to use, otherwise Avere defaults to time.windows.com.
* <a name="timezone"></a>[timezone](#timezone) - (Optional) The clusters local timezone.  Choose from a timezone defined in the [timezone file](timezone.go).  The default is "UTC".
* <a name="dns_server"></a>[dns_server](#dns_server) - (Optional) A space separated list of up to 3 DNS Server IP Addresses.
* <a name="dns_domain"></a>[dns_domain](#dns_domain) - (Optional) Name of the network's DNS domain.
* <a name="dns_search"></a>[dns_search](#dns_search) - (Optional) A space separated list of up to 6 domains to search during host-name resolution.
* <a name="proxy_uri"></a>[proxy_uri](#proxy_uri) - specify the proxy used by `vfxt.py` for the cluster deployment.  The format is usually `https://PROXY_ADDRESS:3128`.  A working example that uses the proxy is described in the [Avere vFXT in a Proxy Environment Example](../../examples/vfxt/proxy).    Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="cluster_proxy_uri"></a>[cluster_proxy_uri](#cluster_proxy_uri) - (Optional) specify the proxy used be used by the Avere vFXT cluster.  The format is usually `https://PROXY_ADDRESS:3128`.  A working example that uses the proxy is described in the [Avere vFXT in a Proxy Environment Example](../../examples/vfxt/proxy).  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="image_id"></a>[image_id](#image_id) - (Optional) specify a custom image id for the vFXT.  This is useful when needing to use a bug fix or there is a marketplace outage.  For more information see the [docs on how to create a custom image for the controller and vfxt](../../examples/vfxt#create-vfxt-controller-from-custom-images).  Alternatively, you can use an older version from the marketplace by running the following command and using the "urn" as the value to the `image_id`: `az vm image list --location westeurope -p microsoft-avere -f vfxt -s avere-vfxt-node --all`.  For example, the following specifies an older urn `image_id = "microsoft-avere:vfxt:avere-vfxt-node:5.3.61"`.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="vfxt_cluster_name"></a>[vfxt_cluster_name](#vfxt_cluster_name) - (Required) this is the name of the vFXT cluster that is shown when you browse to the management ip.  To help Avere support, choose a name that matches the Avere's purpose.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="vfxt_admin_password"></a>[vfxt_admin_password](#vfxt_admin_password) - (Required) the password for the vFXT cluster.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="vfxt_ssh_key_data"></a>[vfxt_ssh_key_data](#vfxt_ssh_key_data) - (Optional) deploy the cluster using the ssh public key for authentication instead of the password, this is useful to align with policies.
* <a name="vfxt_node_count"></a>[vfxt_node_count](#vfxt_node_count) - (Required) the number of nodes to deploy for the Avere cluster.  The count may be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 16.  If the cluster is already deployed, this will result in scaling up or down to the node count.  It requires about 15 minutes to delete and add each node in a scale-up or scale-down scenario.
* <a name="node_cache_size"></a>[node_cache_size](#node_cache_size) - (Optional) The cache size in GB to use for each Avere vFXT VM.  There are two options: 1024 or 4096 where 4096 is the default value.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="enable_nlm"></a>[enable_nlm](#enable_nlm) - (optional) set to false to disable NLM on the vserver.  By default this is set to true.  Warning: toggling this parameter is destructive and restarts armada and will result in a multi-minute outage.
* <a name="vserver_first_ip"></a>[vserver_first_ip](#vserver_first_ip) - (Optional, but also requires [vserver_ip_count](#vserver_ip_count) to be set) To ensure predictable vserver ranges for dns pre-population, specify the first IP of the vserver.  This will create consecutive ip addresses based on the maximum of [vfxt_node_count](#vfxt_node_count) or [vserver_ip_count](#vserver_ip_count).  The following configuration is recommended:
    1. ensure the Avere vFxt has a dedicated subnet,
    2. consider a range at the end of the subnet, and
    3. consider room for scale-up and add all the addresses.  If you scale-up / scale-down we recommend choosing the max of 32 addresses.
    
  Azure will take the first 4 address (eg. .0-.3 on a /24), and the controller and Avere vFXT will take 2+(n*2) ip addresses where n is the value of the maximum of [vfxt_node_count](#vfxt_node_count) or [vserver_ip_count](#vserver_ip_count) (eg. .4-.10 on a /24 subnet).  Also at the end of the range, Azure will consume the broadcast address (eg. .255 on a /24 subnet).  More details on Azure reserved subnets in the [virtual networks faq](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-faq#are-there-any-restrictions-on-using-ip-addresses-within-these-subnets).  The default is to let the deployment automatically add the vserver ip addresses.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="vserver_ip_count"></a>[vserver_ip_count](#vserver_ip_count) - (Optional, but also requires [vserver_first_ip](#vserver_first_ip) to be set).  Set this to the maximum node count that will be used for this cluster.  To avoid an unbalanced load because cluster size is not a multiple, we recommend setting to the max of 32 ip addresses.  Note: cluster re-created if modified.
* <a name="global_custom_settings"></a>[global_custom_settings](#global_custom_settings) - (Optional) these are custom settings provided by Avere support to match advanced use case scenarios.  They are a list of strings of the form "SETTINGNAME CHECKCODE VALUE".
* <a name="vserver_settings"></a>[vserver_settings](#vserver_settings) - (Optional) these are custom settings provided by Avere support to match advanced use case scenarios.  They are a list of strings of the form "SETTINGNAME CHECKCODE VALUE".  Do not prefix with the vserver as it is automatically detected.

* <a name="name"></a>[name](#name) - (Required) the unique name for the core filer
* <a name="fqdn_or_primary_ip"></a>[fqdn_or_primary_ip](#fqdn_or_primary_ip) - (Required)  The primary IP address or fully qualified domain name of the core filer.  This may also be a space-separated list of IP addresses or domain names, where subsequent network names are used in advanced networking configurations.
* <a name="filer_class"></a>[filer_class](#filer_class) - (Optional) One of the following predefined values that describes this core filer. If no CIFS ACL junctions will exist to the core filer then the default of "Other" may be used.  NetApp clusters newer than 2016 generally use C-mode or `NetappClustered`; to confirm run `showmount -e` against the ip , and it shows `'/'` then it is a clustered netapp.
    * NetappNonClustered
    * NetappClustered
    * EmcIsilon
    * Other
* <a name="cache_policy"></a>[cache_policy](#cache_policy) - (Required) the cache policy for the core filer. and can be any of the following values:
    | Cache_policy string | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | "Clients Bypassing the Cluster" | Use this cache policy when some of your clients are mounting the Avere cluster and others are mounting the core filer directly. |
    | "Clients Bypassing the Cluster**N**" | This uses "Clients Bypassing the Cluster" as the foundation, but then allows you to set an integer number for N greater than or equal to 0 for the check attribute period. |
    | "Read Caching" | Use this cache policy when file read performance is the most critical resource of your workflow. |
    | "Read and Write Caching" | Use this cache policy when a balance of read and write performance is desired. |
    | "Full Caching" | Use this cache policy with cloud core filers or to optimize for op reduction to the core filer. |
    | "Isolated Cloud Workstation" | useful for vdi workstations reading and writing to separate locations as described in [Cloud Workstations](../../examples/vfxt/cloudworkstation) |
    | "Collaborating Cloud Workstation" | useful for vdi workstations reading and writing to the same content as described in [Cloud Workstations](../../examples/vfxt/cloudworkstation) |
    | "Read Only High Verification Time" | Use this for read heavy data, where changes in the data are infrequent. |
* <a name="auto_wan_optimize"></a>[auto_wan_optimize](#auto_wan_optimize) - (Optional) - enables best core filer performance over a WAN.  The default is true, since most applications will be to an on-prem core filer.  Also, autoWanOptimize it not required for storage filers as it is always automatically applied for cloud storage filers.
* <a name="nfs_connection_multiplier"></a>[nfs_connection_multiplier](#nfs_connection_multiplier) - (Optional) Use this to parallelize the number of calls to the core filer.  The default is 4, but the range is [1,23].
* <a name="ordinal_2"></a>[ordinal](#ordinal_2) - (Optional) - this specifies the order that the core filers are added. The default is 0, and the core filers are added in ascending numerical order followed by ascending alphabetical order on name.
* <a name="fixed_quota_percent"></a>[fixed_quota_percent](#fixed_quota_percent) - (Optional) - specifies the percent of the cache to be initially set when created, but will float dynamically depending on cache usage.  A default of 0 means to use the default provided by the cache.  The fixed quota percent are integers of range [0,100], and the sum must not exceed 100.  The quota is only balanced when starting from no core filers: if one or more core filers exists, then no balancing will occur.
* <a name="custom_settings_2"></a>[custom_settings](#custom_settings_2) - (Optional) - these are custom settings provided by Avere support to match advanced use case scenarios.  They are a list of strings of the form "SETTINGNAME CHECKCODE VALUE".  Do not prefix with the mass name as it is automatically detected.
* [junction](#junction) - (Required) this specifies the junction block as described below.
 
---

A <a name="junction"></a>`junction` block supports the following:
* <a name="namespace_path"></a>[namespace_path](#namespace_path) - (Required) this is the exported namespace from the Avere vFXT. 
* <a name="cifs_share_name_2"></a>[cifs_share_name](#cifs_share_name_2) - (Optional) this is an SMB2 share exported from the Avere vFXT. 
* <a name="core_filer_cifs_share_name"></a>[core_filer_cifs_share_name](#core_filer_cifs_share_name) - (Optional) this is the CIFS share name on the core filer, and may only be specified for the Netapp* and EmcIsilon modes.  Specifying this automatically causes the junction to use 'cifs' access instead of 'posix' access. 
* <a name="cifs_share_ace_2"></a>[cifs_share_ace](#cifs_share_ace_2) - (Optional) this is an export rule described in the [CIFS Share ACE section](#cifs-share-ace).  If not specified, the junction uses the most permissive access set to `Everyone`.
* <a name="cifs_create_mask_2"></a>[cifs_create_mask](#cifs_create_mask_2) - (Optional) An octal value specifying the bitwise mask for the UNIX permissions for a newly created file.  If not specified, the default is 0744 for file create, and 0777 when modified from a native Windows NT security dialog box.
* <a name="cifs_dir_mask_2"></a>[cifs_dir_mask](#cifs_dir_mask_2) - (Optional) An octal value specifying the bitwise mask for the UNIX permissions for a newly created directory.  If not specified, the default is 0755 for directory create, and 0777 when modified from a native Windows NT security dialog box.
* <a name="core_filer_export"></a>[core_filer_export](#core_filer_export) - (Required) this is the export from the hardware core filer.
* <a name="export_subdirectory"></a>[export_subdirectory](#export_subdirectory) - (Optional) if the export does not point directly to the core filer directory that you want to associate with this junction, add the relative subdirectory path here.  (Do not begin the path with "/".)  If the subdirectory does not already exist, it will be created automatically.
* <a name="export_rule_2"></a>[export_rule](#export_rule_2) - (Optional) this is an export rule described in the [Export Rules section](#export-rules).  If not specified, the junction uses the most permissive rule set by the default policy.

# Export Rules

Each junction may specify export rules.  The export rules control client access to core filer exports.  More detailed information on export rules can be found in the [Avere OS Configuration Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/ops_guide/4_7/html/gui_export_rules.html#export-rules) or the [XML-RPC API Guide](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/pdf/avere-os-5-1-xmlrpc-api-2019-01.pdf) under the method `nfs.addRule`.

The `export_rule` is of the format `"<host1>(<options>) <host2>(<options>)..."`.  The host may be a fully qualified domain name, an IP address, an IP address with a mask (CIDR notation), or '*' to represent all clients.

The options describe the access rules and are specified in any order as follows:
* **access level** - the access level may be read-only `ro` or read/write `rw`.  If not specified, the default is `ro`.
* **squash** - this setting determines how user identities are sent to the core filer, and one of the following three modes may be specified.  If not specified, the default is `all_squash`.
    1. `no_root_squash` - UIDs are passed verbatim from the client to the core filer.
    1. `root_squash` - this will map the root user to the anonymous user (-2)
    1. `all_squash` - this will map all user ids to the anonymous user (-2)
* **allow SUID bits** - specify `allow_suid` if you want to allow files on the core filer to change user IDs (SUID) and group IDs (SGID) upon client access.  If not specified, the default is to disable.  
* **allow submounts** - specify `allow_submounts` to let clients also access subdirectories of the core filer export point.  If not specified, the default is to disable.

**Example 1:** `export_rule = "10.0.0.5"` or  `export_rule = "10.0.0.5()"`

This rule will restrict junction access to only host `10.0.0.5` with all the settings mapped to their default values:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| access level | `ro` |
| squash | `all_root_squash` |
| allow SUID bits | `no` |
| allow submounts | `no` |

**Example 2:** `export_rule = "rendermanager.vfx.com(rw,no_root_squash,allow_suid,allow_submounts) 10.0.1.0/24(rw,no_root_squash,allow_suid,allow_submounts) *()"`

This rule enables the following junction access to host `rendermanager.vfx.com` and IP range `10.0.1.0/24`:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| access level | `rw` |
| squash | `no_root_squash` |
| allow SUID bits | `yes` |
| allow submounts | `yes` |

All other hosts will be restricted to the following access:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| access level | `ro` |
| squash | `all_root_squash` |
| allow SUID bits | `no` |
| allow submounts | `no` |

**Example 3:** `export_rule = ""` or `export_rule` not specified

This rule causes no action to be taken, and the junction inherits the default policy where all hosts `"*"` have the following settings:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |    
| access level | `rw` |
| squash | `no_root_squash` |
| allow SUID bits | `yes` |
| allow submounts | `yes` |

# CIFS Share ACE

Each CIFS share may specify a share ACE to control access to the share.  More information about CIFS management can be found in the [Active Directory Administrator Guide to Avere FXT Deployment](https://azure.github.io/Avere/legacy/pdf/ADAdminCIFSACLsGuide_20140716.pdf).

The `cifs_share_ace` is of the form `"<user1/group1>(<options>) <user2/group2>(<options>)..."`.  The user or group may be a name or security ID (SID).  The name may also include the domain prefix (for example, 'DOMAIN\UserOrGroup').

The options describe the access rules and are specified in any order as follows:
* **type** - the type of ACE (either 'ALLOW' or 'DENY')
* **permission** - the type of permission being allowed or denied - either 'READ', 'CHANGE', or "FULL".

**Example 1:** `cifs_share_ace = "azureuser"` or  `cifs_share_ace = "azureuser()"`

This rule will restrict cifs share access to only user `azureuser` with all the settings mapped to their default values:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `ALLOW` |
| permission | `READ` |

**Example 2:** `cifs_share_ace = "RENDERING\rendergroup(ALLOW,FULL) RENDERING\renderwranglers(ALLOW,FULL)"`

This rule will restrict cifs share access to group `RENDERING\rendergroup` and group `RENDERING\renderwranglers` with the following values:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `ALLOW` |
| permission | `FULL` |

**Example 3:** `cifs_share_ace = ""` or `cifs_share_ace` not specified

This rule causes no action to be taken, and the junction inherits the default policy where group `Everyone` has the following settings:
| Access Parameter | Value |
| --- | --- |
| type | `ALLOW` |
| permission | `FULL` |

# Managed Identities

Managed identities are a way to grant access to azure resources from virtual machines.  More information can be seen in the [Managed Identity Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).  By default the Avere vFXT is created with a system assigned managed identity.  However, customers may want to choose user assigned identities since this means the controller or machine running `vfxt.py` does not have to be created with powerful roles of `Owner` or `User Access Administrator`.

The Avere provider accepts a user defined managed identity through argument `user_assigned_managed_identity`.  This identity is installed via a controller or machine with `vfxt.py` that also needs a user defined managed identity.  Terraform is used to deploy the controller, and it needs a principal setup with roles.  The following table shows these three levels of identity with the resource group (RG) scopes and built-in role assignments required for each managed identity:

   | Principal or Managed Identity | Description | Managed Identity RG Scope | VNET RG Scope | Storage RG Scope | VFXT RG Scope |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

   | **(Managed Identity) vFXT** | the vFXT manages Azure resources for new vServers, and in response to HA events |  | [Avere Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#avere-operator)  | [Avere Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#avere-operator) | [Avere Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#avere-operator) |

An example that shows the creation of the above principal and managed identities is the [User Assigned Managed Identity](../../examples/vfxt/user-assigned-managed-identity/) example.

# Attributes Reference

# Build the Terraform Provider binary on Linux

There are three approaches to access the provider binary:
1. Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/Azure/Avere/releases).
2. Deploy the [jumpbox](../../examples/jumpbox) - the jumpbox automatically builds the provider.
3. Build the binary using the instructions below.

_Note_: The provider is built as a go module - this lets you build outside your GOPATH.

The following build instructions work in https://shell.azure.com, Centos, or Ubuntu:

1. if this is centos, install git and jq

    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y git jq
    ```

1. if this is ubuntu, install jq

    ```bash
    sudo apt get install -y jq
    ```

1. If not already installed go, install golang:

    ```bash
    GO_DL_FILE=go1.16.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    wget --tries=12 --wait=5 https://dl.google.com/go/$GO_DL_FILE
    sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf $GO_DL_FILE
    rm -f $GO_DL_FILE
    echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin" >> ~/.profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

1. build and install the provider code
    ```bash
    cd
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/Avere.git
    # build the cache warmer
    cd $AZURE_HOME_DIR/Avere/src/terraform/providers/terraform-provider-avere
    go build
    # install the avere provider
    version=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/Avere/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name | sed -e 's/[^0-9]*\([0-9].*\)$/\1/')
    mkdir -p ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/avere/$version/linux_amd64
    cp terraform-provider-avere ~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/avere/$version/linux_amd64
    ```

# Build the Terraform Provider binary on Windows

Here are the instructions for building the windows binary:

1. browse to https://git-scm.com/download/win and install git.

1. browse to https://golang.org/doc/install and install golang.

1. open a new powershell command prompt and type the following to checkout the code:

```powershell
# change to your desired directory
$env:SRC='c:\src'
mkdir $env:SRC -Force
cd $env:SRC
git clone https://github.com/Azure/Avere.git
cd $env:SRC\Avere\src\terraform\providers\terraform-provider-avere
go build
# install the provider
# get the latest download URL
$latestPage         = Invoke-WebRequest https://api.github.com/repos/Azure/Avere/releases/latest
($latestpage.Content|ConvertFrom-Json|Select tag_name).tag_name -match '[^0-9]*([0-9\.].*)$'
$version            = $matches[1]

# download the provider
$pluginsDirectory   = "$Env:APPDATA\terraform.d\plugins\registry.terraform.io\hashicorp\avere\$version\windows_amd64"
md $pluginsDirectory -ea 0
$pluginPath         = "$pluginsDirectory\terraform-provider-avere_v$version.exe"
Write-Output "copying the avere plugin to $pluginPath"
copy terraform-provider-avere.exe $pluginPath
```
